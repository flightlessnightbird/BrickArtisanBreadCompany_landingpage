            <h2>THE SCIENCE</h2>
            <p>True sourdough bread is unique. It’s nothing like the supermarket dollar loaf and if you’ve never had it, it’s unlikely you’ve ever eaten any bread quite like it. Sourdough is substantial and flavoursome and in its own right a work of art. It takes passion, chemistry, creativity and a can-do attitude to create a loaf that you’re truly proud of.</p>
            <p>The heart of sourdough is the humble sourdough bug (also known as the starter, mother or levain). The bug has two simple ingredients: flour and water. However as soon as you mix these together, an enzyme naturally present in the flour (called amylase) is activated and goes to work breaking down the complex flour starches into sugars. Wild yeast and good bacteria both feed on these sugars during fermentation.</p>
            <p>Wild yeast is a different strain of yeast than commercial, packaged yeast. It lives all around us in the air and on plants, grains, and fruits. There is some naturally present in the flour and more gets incorporated when you stir the flour and water together. The wild yeast is the leavening agent (it makes it rise) and also produces alcohol and carbon dioxide as a by-product a.k.a. extra flavour!</p>
            <p>Also residing in our sourdough bug is a friendly, non-harmful bacteria called lactobacillus. Lactobacillus also feed on sugar and produce two kinds of acid as a by-product: lactic acid that gives the sourdough its mellow rich flavor and acetic acid that gives its tang and punch.</p>
            <p>Many people usually intolerant to gluten find they can consume sourdough without any adverse effects. That’s because the amylase enzyme breaks down the gluten into sugars making it easily digestible.</p>

            <h2>FERMENTED FOOD</h2>
            <p>Fermentation is a traditional way of preserving food that’s been used for thousands of years. Essentially the bacteria naturally present in food begins to break down starches and sugars.</p>
            <p>This produces lactic acid which stops the growth of ‘bad’ bacteria, thus preserving the food, and as a by product creates beneficial enzymes, b-vitamins, Omega-3 fatty acids, and various strains of probiotics. And because the bacteria predigests the food, the result is that the food is easier for us to digest a.k.a. it’s super tummy friendly (and delicious)!</p>
            <p>Here at BABCO we fully embrace fermented foods. We pickle our own veggies, we make our own sauerkraut and we sell organic Kombucha. We want our food to help you feel great inside and out.</p>

            <h2>ABOUT BABCO</h2>
            <p id="heavy">BABCO stands for Brick Artisan Bread Company. We are a boulangerie/patisserie that makes everything by hand, using modest ingredients to create everyday luxury.
              We believe in incredible food, sustainable business, and building community. Our team are a talented bunch of individuals, young and not young and all in different stages of life. But we all share the same vision; bringing joy to the people who come to BABCO.</p>
            <h4>How it all began....</h4>
            <p>BABCO started simply; a love for pizza, a kitchen without an oven and a husband keen to bake!</p>
            <p>Jeremy and Alice have always found fantastic enjoyment in baking and cooking together; preferably from scratch and frequently experimenting with different cuisines. Newly married, J&A moved into their first rental – a furnished granny flat with everything except an oven. Not satisfied with the cooking capabilities of the rental’s microwave Jeremy built a pizza oven in the backyard (yes, with the landlords approval). And thus begun the love for cooking with fire and baking from scratch.</p>
            <p>The first real step toward’s making BABCO a reality began when Jeremy, a keen TradeMe browser, took a gamble and placed a bid on two wood-fired pizza ovens. The dream was to find himself a job that would allow the time to be able to regularly practice making sourdough bread. He won the auction and suddenly they had a mobile food business. With the pizza trailers came the need for a prep kitchen, equipment and a solid game plan. Luckily Alice’s Aunty had a kitchen, Jeremy knew where he could find the equipment and although neither really had the game plan they knew enough to be able to google the rest. The odd pizza park up grew very quickly into selling bread and pastries on the side of the road, cooking pizzas three times a week and delivering bread to homes around Palmerston North. Within 9 months the demand had grown beyond the capabilities of their prep kitchen and there was only one thing to do. Quit the day jobs and go full-time.</p>
            <p>Fast-forward to now and BABCO has grown exponentially into more than Jeremy or Alice could’ve ever imagined. It’s a chance to be creative, make great food, build a unique business and provide the community with a space to be inspired and indulge.</p>

                <h4>BABCO ON ALBERT ST</h4>
                <p>BABCO on Albert is our first real shop. It's a beautiful wee space that we are blessed to call our own. We designed the space ourselves and even had a hand in the building. All of the timber used in the retail front is 100 year old New Zealand Macrocarpa purchased from Watts to Mill. The ECO leaf wallpaper was found with the help of talented Interior Designer Letitia from SPACESIDS. Our shop flowers are from Mavis and Peony. We couldn't have asked for better people to help make our shop dreams come true!</p>
